		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In order for a game studio to internally propose an idea for a game, they create what is called a game pitch document. This game pitch document has everything from the game premise, setting, and lore, to how game mechanics work, controls, as well as a development schedule and marketing strategy for the game itself.</p>
		<p>The thing is, there is no "how to" manual for writing a game pitch document, so each document is made in a different way. They all carry the same elements, but some companies may opt for a bulleted list or paragraphs to tell you how the HUD will look, while another company may just show you an image instead.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this project is to highlight those differences, as well as show you how one pitch may have a ton of information about the proposed lore, while another might focus on a cool way to market the game instead. There really isn't a wrong way to make a game pitch as long as you have all of the main elements, the ones of which we cover in this project listed here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="GP">Gameplay</span></li>
			<li><span class="setting">Setting</span></li>
			<li><span class="lore">Lore</span></li>
			<li><span class="PC">Playable Characters</span></li>
			<li><span class="NPC">Non-playable Characters</span></li>
			<li><span class="dev">Development/Marketing</span></li>
		</ul>
