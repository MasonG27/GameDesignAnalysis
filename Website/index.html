		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In order for a game studio to internally propose an idea for a game, they create what is called a game pitch document. This game pitch document has everything from the game premise, setting, and lore, to how game mechanics work, controls, as well as a development schedule and marketing strategy for the game itself.</p>
		<p>The thing is, there is no "how to" manual for writing a game pitch document, so each document is made in a different way. They all carry the same elements, but some companies may opt for a bulleted list or paragraphs to tell you how the HUD will look, while another company may just show you an image instead.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this project is to highlight those differences, as well as show you how one pitch may have a ton of information about the proposed lore, while another might focus on a cool way to market the game instead. There really isn't a wrong way to make a game pitch as long as you have all of the main elements, the ones of which we cover in this project listed here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="GP">Gameplay</li>
			<li class="setting">Setting</li>
			<li class="lore">Lore</li>
			<li class="PC">Playable Characters</li>
			<li class="NPC">Non-playable Characters</li>
			<li class="dev">Development/Marketing</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<h2>Contents</h2>
		<p>This project consists of four different game pitch documents, the content of which can be found <a href="pitches.html">here</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>BioShock</h3><p></p></li>

					<p>For this project, we want to give a go at comparing different game design
						pitch documents in order to highlight key differences and similarities such
						as detailed inclusion on character design vs sound design, or if a pitch from
						10 years ago includes more images than modern documents. There is tons of
						diversity in these documents so it will be interesting to present some of
						them in a different way by markup through XML. We are hoping that the end
						result will aid us in the future for creating a game pitch document.
						A video game pitch document is something developer teams use to
						present a game to a publisher to help them create, fund and sell their game.
						Developers and publishers are most often completely different companies but
						work together to sell a finished product. To simplify it, developers create
						the game and bring it to life, while publishers use marketing, management
						and PR to make sure the game is a success and profitable. A key element with
						pitch documents is there is no set way or structure on how to create them.
						They are a dynamic document that often revolve around the style of game
						being created. For example, if the game is very strong on the aesthetic of
						art then they should include lots of concept art and color, just like the
						Flame in the Flood which we included in our research. However there are
						completely different documents that are paragraph heavy like Wasteland 2
						that just are focused on explaining mechanics, new elements and interesting
						story lore. </p>
					<p>For our research question, we want to explore how the structures and material
						presented in the pitch documents differentiate and what developers highlight
						the most in these documents?</p>
					<p>-The whole point to creating a pitch document is to sell your game.</p>
					<p>-Differences due to the date they were created.</p>
					<p>-Some pitches revolve around art style to sell their game.</p>
					<p>-Some structures are paragraph oriented, others contain bulleted lists and
						some include tons of images. </p> There are a couple things to note about
					what is “expected” when it comes to a pitch document. <p><b>Know your
							audience</b></p>
					<p><b>Know your product</b></p>
					<p><b>Prepare something special</b></p>
					<p><b>Don’t focus on minor details</b></p>
					<p><b>Provide support material</b></p>
					<p><b>Establish a timeline</b></p>
					
					<h1>Project Update 1</h1>
					<p>For the first update we gathered some information and will begin our project on the original bioshock game. 
					After some conversion we got a raw text file and edited slightly to include bullet points and other symbol recognition.</p>

					<h1>Project Update 2</h1>
					<p>For our second update we began to form a schema around the bioshock game. It is going to be changing as we continue to work though because we plan to include 3 other pitch documents in this project.</p>
					<p>We began to form a research question surrounding the other pitch documents we were thinking of adding to the project.</p>
					<p>Added the following pitch documents: The Flame in the Flood as well as the original Diablo game.
					We saw these as great additions as FITF has diversity with lots of images and art while Diablo is a very old document that uses lots of paragraph style.</p>
					<img src="images/FITF.PNG"
						alt="Pitch document from Flame in the Flood" />
					<img src="images/Diablo.PNG"
						alt="Pitch document from the original diablo game" />
					
					<h1>Project Update 3</h1>
					<p>We began to reform the schema in order to be more compatible with multiple pitch documents that vary in structure.</p>
					<img src="images/Schema.PNG"
						alt="This is our schema doc for our project" />
					<p>We added another pitch document to our research, Wasteland 2.</p>
					<img src="images/Wasteland2.PNG"
						alt="Pitch document for Wasteland 2" />
					
					<h1>Project Update 4</h1>
					<p>We made significant progress on xml markup for the bioshock document.</p>
					<img src="images/BioshockMarkup.PNG"
						alt="Bioshock markup screenshot" />
					<p>We also made great progress on the schema, making some adjustments as we progressed through the BioShock document.</p>
					<img src="images/SchemaUpdate1.PNG"
						alt="First major update for our schema" />
					<p>Added lots of content to the website. Continuing to think of different ideas for the final layout in order to keep things accessible and organized.</p>
