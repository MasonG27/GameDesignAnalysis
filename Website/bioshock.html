         <p>Things grow inside you.</p>
         <p><i>"We're part of you now"</i>, you think you hear them
            say.</p>
         <p>You step away from the med bench. The diagnostics screen presents a revolting before
            and after.</p>
         <p>On the left side, the before side, you see yourself. What you were. Human.</p>
         <p>And on the right side...what you are. What you've become. The only way you'll
            survive, the only way you'll-</p>
         <p>From down the corridor, by the power grid: a voice. A sound that floats through the
            air as if swimming on thick, salty brine:</p>
         <p><i>"Prepare ye...prepare ye the way of the Lord-"</i></p>
         <p>You tense and feel the unfamiliar organs working. Your new body comes to life without
            your consent. Chitinous plates slide over your torso, your groin. Bulbous stalks
            breach your forehead like knitting needles, releasing a salty green liquid that
            stings what were once your eyes.</p>
         <p>You grab the rifle that you've modified through a direct nanite feed. The weapon is
            attuned to the jellied mass slithering through the corridor, its ammo designed to
            penetrate the creature's molecular makeup and burn it from the inside. You're glad
            you dropped the surface humidity by half in your last enviro system hack...that
            should slow the Man o War down.</p>
         <p>You can tell by the creature's musky, seaweed stench that it's ready to feed. You
            can
            tell by the moaning quality of its prayers that the mass is aroused by your
            scent.</p>
         <p>And part of you...the part that is alien and new...is drawn to it in turn.</p>

      <h3 id="#Overview">Overview</h3>
      
      <p><span class="dev">BioShock is the spiritual successor to System Shock 2,</span> 1999's game of
         the year. Irrational Games, <span class="dev">the creators of Shock 2 and Freedom
            Force are about to introduce the definitive interactive world simulation. Harnessing
            the key minds behind Thief, System Shock 2 and Freedom Force, as well as the
            rendering powerhouse that is the Unreal Warfare engine, Irrational is poised to
            re-invent the first person action RPG.</span></p>
      
      <p>BioShock is a modern day nightmare of the terrifying nexus between religious
         fanaticism and unbounded science. The player must come to grips with the remnants
         of
         a dangerous cult and the technological and biological horrors they've created in
         their giant underground and undersea complex that lies beneath the sands of a
         seemingly deserted island.</p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">While building on the tried and true first person shooter gameplay,</span> BioShock
         innovates in a number of key areas:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Game Design-BioShock gives the player absolute control; of their environments as
            well as in the creation of their own weapons and bio-modifications. The only
            limit is their imagination.</li>
         
         
         <li>Visuals-The Unreal Warfare engine leveages both the power of today's
            computers...and tomorrows. Using a highly modified version of this engine,
            BioShock features some of the most stunning visuals ever seen in a first-person
            shooter.</li>
         
         
         <li>Physics-BioShock utilizes the industry proven Karma physics engine to provide
            unprecedented in game solid body and "rag doll" support[.]</li>
         
         
         <li>Multiplayer-BioShock allows players to face one another in Story Based
            Deathmatch.</li>
         
         
         <li>Story-BioShock's dark, sophisticated and relentless story is being written by Ken
            Levine, the writer behind System Shock 2, Thief and Freedom Force.</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p><span class="setting">BioShock is a horrifying, sophisticated, visually stunning, open-ended experience
            that will leave players gasping for breath. It is the first person action nightmare
            that only Irrational could deliver.</span></p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#BioShockwill">BioShock will:</h3>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Redefine the first person shooter on console and PC by immersing the player in a
            reactive and modifiable world.</li>
         
         <li>Be the most visually stunning Unreal game ever created.</li>
         
         <li>Unparalleled physics support via the Karma physics engine.</li>
         
         <li>Establish a new franchise that has strong potential as a film and television
            property (Irrational's most recent game, The Lost, has just been sold as a
            feature film to BBC films).</li>
         
         <li>Provide an accessible and transparent interface.</li>
         
         <li>&gt;Tell a mature, terrifying story.</li>
         
         <li>Scare the hell out of people.</li>               
         </ul> 
      <img src="images/BioShock_will_img-01.PNG" alt="image of an electrical room from bioshock"/>
      
      
      <h3 id="#YouareinControl">You are in Control</h3>
      
      <p><span class="PC">The player takes on the role of Carlos Cuello, a down and out "deprogrammer" assigned
            to infiltrate a religious cult on a remote island and "rescue" a wealthy heiress
            from the clutches of the cultists. Once on the island, however, you find out that
            all is not as it seems.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">BioShock features an unprecedented level of player customization and interaction
            during the course of play. This customization is accessed through three different
            axes -- Weapons, Environmental manipulation and Genetic modifications.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="PC">Players will be able to use their resources to conceive and construct their own
            weapons, alter their surroundings and even mutate the very nature of their cellular
            structure!</span></p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#MakeyourOwnWeapons">Make your Own Weapons</h3>
      
      <p><span class="GP">In most first-person shooters players can expect the standard array of modern and
            sci-fi weapons including a pistol, shotgun, chaingun, and sniper rifle. In these
            games you find the 8-10 weapons during the course of the game and what you see is
            what you get.</span> In BioShock, your weapons are limited only by your imagination!</p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">BioShock features an incredibly deep weapon system, which is unlike anything the
            shooter genre has ever seen. Inspired by the superpower creation tool in
            Irrational's hit Freedom Force,</span> <span class="GP">players can create any weapon they want from a set
            of attributes and components. For instance, players may start with a stock slug
            thrower. Through the fantastic technology in the cult facility, the player could add
            components such as an extended barrel and magnifying scope to create a sniper
            rifle.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">Players can modify their weapons to fit the current situation. Are you having trouble
            with the hard-shelled lobster mutant? Modify your base shotgun to fire acid filled
            pellets in addition to the normal buckshot. Still not getting enough stopping power
            from your shotgun? Add a few more barrels to make a quadruple-barreled
            monstrosity.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">"Vanilla" weapon archetypes (e.g. slug thrower, missile launcher, chemical projector,
            etc.) that are found around the island can be molded into more powerful, customized
            versions (e.g. fully automatic acid tipped armored piercing assault rifle, etc.)
            These upgrades may improve the weapon in several aspects, but the more a weapon is
            upgraded, the more unstable it can become. Players can tweak and modify variables
            on
            all of their weapons including:</span></p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>rate of fire</li>
         
         <li>accuracy</li>
         
         
         
         
         <li>range</li>
         
         <li>severity of recoil</li>
         
         <li>usable ammo types</li>
         
         <li>clip size</li>
         
         <li>reload time</li>
         
         <li>reliability -- affects how often the weapon jams</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p>These modifications wont be cheap though. Players have to wisely use their resources
         to create a good variety of weapons to deal with the various terrors of the island.
         These additions will also modify the visuals of the in-game representations of the
         weapons to create weapons never-before-seen in a first person shooter.</p>
      
      <p>Weapon examples:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Triple barreled, fully-auto shotgun</li>
         
         <li>Magnetically powered, silent rail gun</li>
         
         <li>Magnetic field grenades (The grenade explodes creating a powerful magnetic field
            pulling robots into its field. It can even cause bullets to change
            direction!)</li>
         
         <li>Laser sighted sniper rifle...that fires acid coated rounds!</li>
         
         <li>Chain lightning tazer pistol.</li>
         </ul>
      
      
      <h3 id="#Hackingsecurity">Hacking security</h3>
      
      <p><span class="dev">Like in System Shock 2, BioShock players will be challenged by the island's highly
            sophisticated security system.</span> <span class="GP">Players will have to deal with cameras that can sound
            alarms, stationary turret emplacements, security robots, and regular security sensor
            sweeps.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">Players are not helpless against these systems, though. They can deal with them in
            a
            variety of ways including directly attacking the systems, quietly shutting them down
            for a period, or commandeering them for their own uses. For instance, players can
            access security terminals and hack into them. Once into the system the player can
            do
            a variety of things: </span></p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Shut down the camera security system.</li>
         
         <li>Shut down (or take control of) security turrets.</li>
         
         <li>Set off false alarms to divert the enemy's attention.</li>
         
         <li>Commandeer security robots and control them and their powerful arsenal remotely!
            Players lose control of their avatar but get a first-person perspective from the
            robot and now control it directly. But be careful, your avatar is helpless while
            in control of the robot.</li>
         </ul>
      <img src="images/Hacking_security_img-01.PNG" alt="image of the same electrical room but with an enemy on one of the pipes."/>
      
      
      <h3 id="#ModtheWorld!">Mod the World!</h3>
      
      <p><span class="dev">In System Shock 2, Irrational allowed you to manipulate the environment in a few
            minor ways. In most games, elements like fog and advanced lighting are strictly
            aesthetic.</span> <span class="GP">In BioShock, Irrational is taking hacking to the next level. Players will
            not only be able to do all of the aforementioned hacking, but will also be able to
            hack the behavior of the environment itself! Fog will thicken as the humidity goes
            up, heat blurring will distort the players vision as the , etc.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="PC">By hacking into special terminals distributed around the mysterious complex, players
            are able to gain access to the environmental controls. Using these controls, the
            player will be able to change the very nature of the game space.</span> Imagine:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Increase/decrease oxygen content - Increasing the O2[attn: needs to be a little
            2], in an area causes explosives to have larger blast radius and deal more
            damage.</li>
         
         <li>Magnetize floor - Causes robots to move more slowly and metal projectiles to be
            attracted to the floor. Grenades now become sticky bombs.</li>
         
         <li>Ionize the air - Increases range and damage of electrical weapons.</li>
         
         <li>Gravitational field manipulation - Increase or decrease the gravitational field
            in the area. Decreased gravity allows players to jump higher and projectiles fly
            farther before falling to the ground. Increased gravity slows down Als and the
            player.</li>
         
         <li>Electrify the floor - Causes electrical bolts to play across the floor, damaging
            enemies but making a very dangerous area for you as well.</li>
         
         <li>Flood a room - Can drown some enemies, but gives aquatic mutants a distinct
            advantage.</li>
         
         <li>Manipulate temperature - Increasing room temperature can render players invisible
            to thermal security sweeps, but gives cold-blooded enemies a speed boost.
            Decreasing the air temperature causes cold-blooded enemies to move more
            slowly.</li>
         </ul>
      
      
      <h3 id="#GeneticEnhancements">Genetic Enhancements</h3>
      
      <p><span class="PC">Using the cult's bizarre biogenetic manipulation technology to modify their body to
            survive, the player can sacrifice their humanity to turn themselves into the
            ultimate fighting machine. Using bioengineering terminals found around the facility,
            the player can access advanced genotypes and merge them with his human form. This
            allows the player to take on capabilities of various aquatic and amphibious
            creatures.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">For instance, the player might discover the Hydrozoan genotype (jellyfish). This
            genotype will allow the player to turn his skin gelatinous, poison enemies with a
            touch and appear nearly invisible in the shadows!</span></p>
      
      <p>Some other Genotypes:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Crustacean: hard shells, claw based secondary attack, etc.</li>
         
         <li>Electric eel: echo-electrical senses, electrical attacks, etc.</li>
         
         <li>And much more!</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p><span class="PC">As the game proceeds, the player can find powerful genetic sequences. Once these are
            decoded, the player can mutate himself into different genotypes.</span> <span class="GP">Each genotype has
            different strengths and weaknesses and are appropriate for different in game
            situations. The individual genotypes can be individually improved (e.g.making the
            Hydrozoan (Jellyfish)) genotype more transparent and therefore less visible to
            enemies and security systems.</span> Unless, of course, said enemy is a robot that only
         sees in the infrared spectrum...</p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#Summary">Summary</h3>
      
      <p><span class="dev">The first person shooter market on PC and especially console is stronger than ever.
            The race is on to figure out who is going to be the next Halo or Half Life. The
            staff at Irrational has demonstrated a unique ability to innovate in the first
            person market in both Thief and System Shock 2. BioShock will be the realization of
            the promise of those games.</span></p>

      <h3 id="#Interface">Interface</h3>
      
      <p><span class="GP">BioShock is a first person shooter plus, not an RPG with shooter elements. The
            pacing, visuals and level of action all need to be on par with the best of action
            shooters. Thusly, the interface must adhere, for the most part, to standard
            first-person conventions in control.</span></p>
      
      <p>Every action in the game falls underneath these core tasks.</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Character movement</li>
         
         <li>Mouselook aim and shooting</li>
         
         <li>Interact with objects in the world.</li>
         
         <li>Changing ammo types Different enemies are more or less vulnerable to
            different types of ammo (e.g. Armored foes fear armor piercing rounds, but
            are less concerned with high explosive munitions)
            </li>
         
         <li>Changing fire modes Semi OR fully automatic, grenades that can bounce OR
            stick, armor piercing rounds dripping with corrosive acid fired from a
            scoped sniper rifle with IR capability, etc.
            </li>
         </ul>
      
      <p>Our interface must fulfill two goals:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>At heart, it is the interface of a first person shooter</li>
         
         <li>Any complexity beyond that must be: Introduced slowly over time
            Intuitive and simple to use.
            </li>
         </ul>

      <h3 id="#TheInterfaceCommandments">The Interface Commandments</h3>
      
      <p>In keeping with the design goals of BioShock, we've eliminated or radically
         streamlined almost all of the complexity of interface management. The shooter market
         simply will not bear overly complex interfaces.</p>
      
      <p>We've accomplished this via a couple of key changes, which we like to call the "Three
         Commandments"</p> 
      <p>1 - Thou shall
         not have to deal with an overly complex inventory system</p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">In System Shock 2, the player had to deal with numerous inventory items that he
            dragged around the screen with a mouse and placed in various inventory "slots". Not
            the case in BioShock.</span> The three types of objects the player can pick up are:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Ammo and Resources - Ammo is picked up and stored like every other FPS on the
            planet. As the player walks over it in the world, he "vacuums" it up. The player
            can never "drop" ammunition, he can only expend it via his weapons. Resources
            such as nanites, the currency of the BioShock world, are handled in the same way
            except they are expended in the tech stations (see below).</li>
         
         <li>Weapons - Weapon pick up and weapon dropping is handled much like Halo. The
            player can only have four weapons at any one time.</li>
         
         <li>Quest Items - The player will automatically pick up quest items and automatically
            "use" them at the appropriate time (for example, if the item is a keycard, it
            will be used when the player interacts with the relevant locked door. Or if the
            player wants to upgrade his crustacean form, first he must find a genetic
            sequence that will allow him to do so. These items will be automatically
            expended when the player interacts with the appropriate genetic modification
            machine.</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p>2 - Thou shall not be bogged down with countless interface screens</p>
      
      <p>System Shock 2 featured a bewildering variety of Windows-like interface screens that
         the player had to manage-- Weapon modding, hacking, paper doll, inventory, research,
         weapon repair, etc. The player was forced to manage this complexity through a
         Windows 95 style set of interface screens, full of buttons, tabs, sliders and other
         widgets.</p>
      
      <p>One exception to this rule was character growth, which was handled in a unique,
         refreshing manner. The player couldn't level up his character at will. He could only
         do at specific "Skill Machines" located around the environment.</p>
      
      <p>In Bioshock, we take this system and run with it. There will be numerous machines
         in
         the world for the player to interact with. The interface for using all of these
         machines is identical: i.e. you press a button. Let's use an example:</p>
      
      
      <p>Wandering through the installation, the player comes across a machine mounted on the
         wall. From the distance, it looks something like this:</p>
      <img src="images/Interface_Commandments_img-01.PNG" alt="the interface of a machine which looks like a full red temperature gauge."/> 
      
      <p><span class="GP">This is a temperature control device. So what,
            you may ask? Well, the creatures in BioShock (and the player) are often temperature
            sensitive. Heating things up around the hydrozoan mutation can slow them down, distract
            them and make them less likely to notice you coming up behind them. De-humidifying
            the air will make many foes weak and dehydrated.</span></p>
      
      <p>The red thermometer icon indicates that the temperature as at the hottest of it's
         3
         (perhaps 5) possible settings. The player can tell this from across the room. As the
         player approaches the machine, <span class="GP">they hit the RMB, or the B button on the Xbox.</span> This
         image zooms up in their screen (it will be a 3d model in the world, not a full
         screen interface)</p> 
      <img src="images/Interface_Commandments_img-02.PNG" alt="full red temperature gauge with a up and down arrow, the up arrow is crossed out."/> 
      <p><span class="GP">The
            player can then use the forward and back keys (W and S) on the pc or the left
            thumpad on the Xbox to adjust the temperature. The nanite costs indicates how many
            nanites it will take to make this adjustment. The bar sinister on the top arrow
            means that the temperature is as hot as the system will allow. When the player right
            clicks or hit the B button again, this interface is dismissed and any temperature
            adjustments are made.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Another example is the genotype upgrade machines. These are machines that let the
         player buy new genotypes and upgrade existing genotypes. <span class="GP">Again, the player simply
            has to approach one of these machines and hit the RMB on the PC or the B button on
            the Xbox controller. Each genotype only has 3 skills that can be upgraded, so
            selecting this will be a painless process that only requires (on the PC) the
            [button] and [button] keys to cycle between genotypes, the [button] and [button]
            keys to select an upgrade, a LMB to purchase an upgrade.</span></p>
      <img src="images/Interface_Commandments_img-03.PNG" alt="The interface for genotypes"/> 
      <p>3- Thou shall be led slowly unto the valley of
         gameplay depth.</p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">System Shock 2 made a huge mistake: we dumped all of the complexity on the player
            from moment one. BioShock will address this issue. Besides just massively
            simplifying the interface, BioShock will slowly dole out depth to the player, just
            as the player becomes capable of handling it.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">The first half hour to hour of the game will play just like a first person shooter.</span>
         <span class="GP">Move forward, move back, shoot, etc. Then the player learns he can use different
            types of ammo in his gun. After that, the player comes across an environmental
            control machine. "Hey," they realize after hearing some MP3 logs to this effect, "I
            turn the oxygen up, my shiny new incendiary rounds will be more effective!"</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="PC">Then the player will come across a new weapon and a weapons upgrade machine. "Hey,
            cool, I can upgrade my weapons!" Once the player has the hang of that, we introduce
            him to his first genotype mod machine. This machine will allow him to upgrade his
            single current genotype: human. Later on, after the player is comfortable with this
            system, we will introduce new genotypes for the player to encounter and experiment
            with. The player will be five to seven hours into the game before he has encountered
            all of the major game systems.</span></p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#TheBadGuys">The Bad Guys</h3>
      
      <p><span class="setting">A diverse range of enemies will inhabit the world of BioShock. The enemy list will
            include twisted genetic abominations, fusing human and aquatic creatures DNA with
            terrifying results. The cultists also realize the value of technology and have
            experimented in cybernetic enhancements, turning men into bizarre cybernetic killing
            machines. On top of these two threats, the complex and merciless security system
            with its robots, gun emplacements and surveillance cameras will be a constant thorn
            in our hero's side.</span></p>
      
      <p>Enemy types:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Human zealot cultist</li>
         
         <li>Genetically engineered mammal/aquatic hybrids</li>
         
         <li>Cyborg killers</li>
         
         <li>Robots</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p><span class="GP">All of the various monsters have different combinations of resistances and
            susceptibilities, which make the creation of varied weapons necessary for maximum
            efficiency against the different creatures you encounter.</span></p>
      
      <p>Players also encounter the ghostly apparitions of cultists who realized they had
         signed on for more than they bargained for.</p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#Backstory">Backstory</h3>
      
      <p><span class="lore">You are Carlos Cuello, a down and out former black ops specialist who has been
            drummed out of the service due to psychological instability. Taking a job as a
            deprogrammer (someone who "kidnaps" cult members and de-brainwashes" them), his
            first job finds him undercover, flying towards a remote island called Salvacion with
            members of a cultist religious group called "Serene Dawn". Your job: to find the
            daughter of a captain of industry who has fallen in with the group and bring her
            back to her waiting parents.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">As the plane comes in for a landing, you realize the cultists have seen through your
            cover. You dodge the bullet intended for you and it buries itself in the skull of
            the pilot. Now the fun begins...</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Part 1: Crash</p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">Pulling your pistol from underneath your seat cushion, you are thrown into a duel
            to
            the death with cultists on the plane. A stray cultist bullet slams into the pilot's
            skull, sending him sprawling over his controls. As the plane noses deeper into its
            death plunge, the orientation of the world changes around you. You will have to fend
            off the cultist goons and reach the cockpit before the plane slams into the
            earth.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">Pulling yourself from the wreckage of the crash landing, you find yourself on a
            remote volcanic island. Exploring your surroundings, you realize that the island is
            several miles in size, covered with tropical vegetation and partitioned by
            impassable cliffs of volcanic rock. You see thatched native huts, most of which have
            been burned to the ground. You can see the charred remains of several individuals
            lying around you, their bodies strange amalgamations of humans...and...and what?</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">Progressing through a tunnel carved into the very volcano itself, you must struggle
            through a nightmarish series of encounters in the near darkness. Your gun empty, you
            soon find a new weapon that looks like a strange, custom pistol. It is made of a
            material you have never seen before. It appears smooth, unformed, as if it were
            poured as single piece of alien metal. As you come out of the volcanic tunnel and
            into a valley you see a sight you were totally unprepared for: the cultic compound.
            This is no Jonestown, no rag tag collection of huts and pre-fab tin buildings. This
            is an installation worthy of any superpower. Tall, proud structures of concrete and
            steel loom over you. Paved, lined roads tear into the heart of the jungle. Power
            lines ring the installation and traffic signs provide guidance to the bustling
            population.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">Breaking the eerie silence, a steady stream of recorded liturgy issues forth, from
            the mouth of the cult's leader:</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="lore">What is the measure of a man? Is it the hands and feet? The eyes and ears? Or is it
            the Holy Spint that animates him? If the body is lost, but the soul is saved, is
            that anything less Than a victory?</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="lore">You wonder where everyone went. The place looks like the day after Armageddon. Bodies
            litter the paved pathways and half the buildings stand in ruins. Something has
            happened here, something terrible. You also begin to find bodies of other cultists,
            some with MP3 recorders with audio journals on them. As the tales of the doomed
            cultists begin to unfold, you find yourself wishing the plane you put down had
            instead thrown itself into the earth with you onboard.</span></p>
      
      <p>Part 2 and beyond...</p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">As the player explores the surface installation, they realize they've only seen the
            tip of the iceberg. They soon discover an underground complex that runs deep under
            the earth, with various openings to other parts of the island, including:</span></p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>A lagoon overrun by strange amphibious creatures. Strange tendrils whip out of
            the surf, looking to lacerate the player with barbed fingers.</li>
         
         <li>A torturous path into the heart of a volcano, plagued by mutated seabirds and
            secreted, sniping cultists</li>
         
         <li>A terrifying descent into the bowels of the underground installation, where the
            player comes to the realization that the structures not only go underground, but
            under the ocean itself!</li>
         
         <li>A nightmarish trek through the winding plasti-steel maze of the cultists true
            home deep beneath the ocean's surface. Massive prehistoric fish bear witness to
            the modern horrors that seek to destroy the player...and the very species he
            represents.</li>
         </ul>
      
      <p><span class="setting">The majority of the game will take place indoors, but the outdoor sequences will be
            used to provide more gameplay and aesthetic variety.</span></p>
      
      
      <h3 id="#Multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
      
      <p><span class="GP">The multiplayer aspects of BioShock bring something unique to
            the genre. Story based deathmatch. What is it? Imagine playing the single player game.
            But you're not the protagonist. You're a guy playing on the side of the monsters in
            the
            single player campaign. Instead of predictable Als running at the player, a second
            player (or third, or fourth perhaps) can step into the shoes of various monsters in
            the
            world that are nearby the player. These monsters are played in first person view by
            the
            second player (the monster player). Under the monster players control, these relatively
            weak but numerous Als can stage ambushes, leverage AI monster attacks patterns to
            outflank the player, even play dead and spring back to life as the player comes around
            the corner. How is this done technologically? It's not really a technology challenge.
            It's more of a design challenge. When you build the game, you probably have to lay
            down
            three different kinds of monsters in the editor.</span></p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>a. Monsters who are only active in single player</li>
         
         <li>b. Monsters who are only active in multiplayer</li>
         
         <li>c. Monsters who are active in both single and multiplayer. These monsters will be
            the cause of the most bugs, because they're likely to break stuff in both modes.
            This means: no using monsters who are needed for cutscenes. No using monsters
            who are quest relevant, etc. This will definitely require some thinking.</li>
         </ul>
      
      
      <h3 id="#Balance">Balance</h3>
      
      <p>The more open-ended gameplay becomes, the more stimuli that can be applied to the
         world and applied by the world onto the player, the dicier game balancing
         becomes.</p>
      
      <p>Combinatorial growth as presented in BioShock provide many of the benefits of games
         like Diablo and Freedom Force. It will be impossible to test every possible
         combination</p>
      
      
      <p>of character, weapon and environment in every possible moment of play. To
         successfully balance games with such open-ended systems, we must do two things:</p>
      
      <p>1) Extensively test (i.e. open beta)</p>
      
      <p>2) Quantify, quantify, quantify.</p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">Game balance doesn't exist in the mind; it exists in dozens of Excel spreadsheets.
            In
            these spreadsheets are the hundreds of proposed values that influence gameplay:
            weapon damage, monster hit points, effects of environmental mods, etc. These
            spreadsheets are used as a starting point for testing. In the process of testing,
            inequities are exposed and the data in the spreadsheets must again be modified to
            reflect the findings of the play testing.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">There are no real tricks to balancing. It's work, work, work. Every game Irrational
            has done has been open ended in nature. Sometimes, you learn about balance after
            you've finished the game and it goes out to hundreds of thousands of useful data
            points.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">System Shock 2: Too hard. Freedom Force: Much better, perhaps a little easy. If we
            had a couple more months, it would have been excellent. The Lost: We think pretty
            good. We are self-funding an extension to the project with the publisher's blessing
            to work strictly on balance and performance issues.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">BioShock is budgeted with a nice sized balancing period at the end of the project,
            the time where it is most effective.</span></p>
