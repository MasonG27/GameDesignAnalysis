        <h2>Game Pitches</h2>
        <p>For this project, we currently have four different game pitch documents for you to view and compare how the different companies explained their core elements. Each of these elements will be highlighted a certain color, and the legend will be provided at the side of each page.</p>
        <p>Remember, if you would like to see our code as well as the original source documents, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/MasonG27/GameDesignAnalysis">GitHub repo</a>!</p>
