         <h3 class="#Prologue">Prologue</h3>
         <p>In the <span class="setting">early seventies</span>, an astronomer located a
            cluster of meteors that would cross Earth's path in the summer of <span class="setting">ninety eight</span>. Keeping this secret was the government's
            top priority. First, they did not want to panic the populace. Second, they saw it
            as
            a way to get the upper-hand against the Soviets. Building a meteor defense platform
            became the United States' number one priority. It took <span class="setting">15
               years</span> to build the Citadel Starstation, a highly advanced orbital
            nuclear anti-meteor missile platform. The United States' Citadel Starstation was
            slated to be fully operational by March, just months before the meteors were
            believed to be arriving. Tensions grew with the coming of <span class="setting">1998</span>, the Soviets charging that the space station was merely a
            military launching platform, alarming a number of nonaligned nations.</p>
         <p>Two weeks before Citadel was due for full operation, the station transmitted a
            distress signal. Undetected, a cloud of small meteorites preceded the main cluster.
            Though they were no threat to Earth, Earth's satellites were a different story.
            Immediately after the message was sent, most of the satellites orbiting the planet
            were swept clean from the sky, leaving the great powers blind. In military panic,
            each sent 90 percent of their nuclear arsenals skyward. Although the destruction was
            tremendous, it was not complete. Pockets of civilization remained, some even
            oblivious to the military exchange.</p>
         <p><span class="setting">The world of today is the antithesis of the clean, futuristic society that
               came before. Wasteland is a world in decay. The once glimmering cities of glass
               and steel lie in ruin. Rusted hulls of cars litter the urban environment as a
               reminder of the world that once was.</span></p>
         <p>The survivors of the cataclysm have banded together into small frontier communities.
            Not unlike the Wild West hundreds of years prior, the world of today is an age of
            rugged individualism; a society where the ties between individuals are loose and
            everyone is expected to look after himself and his own.</p>
         <p>Some towns have the benefit of a pre-cataclysm renewable power source, such as a
            small wind turbine or solar dish. In the midst of a <span class="setting">technological dark age</span>, few have the knowledge and means to recreate
            these power sources, making them coveted and often fought-over commodities. The few
            who have the know-how to maintain the old technologies are highly sought after and
            often command a lot of influence.</p>
         <p>On the same day destruction rained down from the sky, a company of U.S. Army
            Engineers were in the southwestern deserts building transportation bridges over dry
            riverbeds. They worked deep in the inhospitable desert valleys, surrounded by a
            number of survivalist communities. Located directly south of their position on that
            day was a newly-constructed federal prison. In addition to housing the nation's
            criminals condemned to death, the prison contained light industrial manufacturing
            facilities.</p>
         <p>Shortly after the cataclysm began, the Engineers, seeking shelter, took over the
            federal prison and expelled the prisoners into the desolate desert to complete their
            sentences. As the weeks passed, they invited the nearby survivalist communities to
            join them and to help them build a new society. Because of each community's
            suspicions towards one another, times were difficult at first. But as time nurtured
            trust, this settlement - which came to be known as <span class="setting">Ranger
               Center</span> - grew to be one of the strongest outposts. Ranger Center even
            proved powerful enough to repel the hands of rancorous criminals who repeatedly
            attacked in attempts to reclaim what was once "rightfully" theirs.</p>
         <p>The citizens of <span class="setting">Ranger Center</span>, after first believing
            that they were the only ones who survived the nuclear cataclysm, soon realized that
            communities beyond the desert's grip had also survived. Because they had such
            success in constructing a new community, they felt compelled to help other survivors
            rebuild and live in peace.</p>
         <p>Toward this end, the Desert Rangers, in the great tradition of the Texas and Arizona
            Rangers a century before, were born.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><span class="lore">&gt;Wasteland 2 begins fifteen years after the events of Wasteland. As a team of
            Desert Rangers, you've vowed to restore order and justice in a land where there is
            none ...but first you must survive. The wastes are expansive and unforgiving. The
            lack of water, intense heat, and zones of flesh-melting radiation are the least of
            your problems.</span> <span class="NPC">Roving gangs, fanatical survivalists, twisted cultists,
            relentless synthetics and bizarre mutated creatures</span> inhabit these lands,
         posing threats at every turn.</p>
      
      
      <h3 class="#ALittleHistory">A Little History</h3>
      
      
      <p><span class="dev">Developed by Interplay, the first Wasteland was released in 1988 on the Apple II,
            C64
            and PC.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">Wasteland was the first post-apocalyptic computer RPG and is recognized as a true
            classic; Computer Gaming World named it the 9th best game of all time. Adored by
            fans, Wasteland is one of the few 20+ year old RPGs that is still discussed on
            Internet forums.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="dev">Wasteland set the RPG standard of its time with its engaging story, open world and
            strong party-driven role-playing system. We are taking these strong elements, that
            made Wasteland a classic, and bringing them into the 21st century, giving you an
            experience unlike anything available today.</span></p>
      
      
      <h3 class="#GameOverview">Game Overview</h3>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">Wasteland 2 reintroduces the concept of party driven adventuring, a style of game-play
            untapped for many years. Having a party of characters will re-introduce game-play
            dynamics rarely seen in today's RPGs.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="lore">As a team of Desert Rangers, it is your job to restore order in this lawless
            post-apocalyptic landscape. How you do it is up to you. Interact with hundreds of
            characters across the world, shaping your own destiny. Who you choose for your team
            will
            add dimension to your party interactions, opening new possibilities for you to explore.</span>
         Will the wastes remember you and your team as diplomatic defenders of justice? As
         a
         group of intimidating, brutish thugs? Or somewhere in between? The choice is yours.</p>
      
      
      <p>The harsh reality of the wastes is that diplomacy and intimidation will only take
         you so
         far. With gangs, cultists and bizarre creatures at every turn, some problems often
         can
         only be settled at the end of a gun. As you and your team <span class="GP">gain
            experience, it is up to you to shape your team's skills and abilities,</span> building
         the perfect fighting force.</p>
      
      
      <h3 class="#Pillars">Pillars</h3>
      
      
      <h4>RPG:</h4>
      <p> <span class="dev">RPGs haven't kept pace with time - they've
            regressed and even worse, taken pride in less roleplaying than before. Important
            elements have been lost over time, sacrificed to technology, art constraints, voice-over
            expenses, and multi-platform console constraints. Wasteland 2 has no such limitations,
            it brings these RPG elements back, takes them out of the attic, and makes them part
            of
            gameplay again.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">True RPGs allow options, allow you to make fundamental choices in customization and
            character creation, and most importantly, allow you to role-play and make your impact
            in
            a living world and see the consequences around you.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>And by consequence, we don't mean token one-node lip service, we mean reactions, even
         a
         chain of reactions that builds over the course of the game. <span class="GP">Even
            simple RPG elements such as the ability to write</span>
         </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">your own character's bio (frequently lost in the console
            generation), importing your own portraits of your characters that you like better
            than what a developer gives you, to larger, more important goals such as tactical
            combat and extended options to approach battles and fights.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>In Wasteland 2, these RPG mechanics are there to be discovered all over again:</p>
      
      
       
      
      <h3 class="#Customization">Customization:</h3>
      
      <p><span class="GP"> The ability to customize, alter, and
            improve your characters is as important as changing the world. Like the original
            Wasteland, your choice of what statistics and skills you invest in gives your
            characters personality, gives you multiple quest solutions, and gives you the
            ability to role-play beyond simply Thief, Fighter, or Mage archetypes. A low
            Charisma, low Agility, and high Strength character who specializes in medical skills
            and brawling can flesh out your characters with a sense of personality that other
            RPGs don't allow for... perhaps that of an injured pit fighter who learned to tend
            the wounds of others in arena brawls in Needles and Vegas. Or a down-on-their-luck
            boxing coach who signed up with the Rangers as an instructor then graduated to going
            on missions to watch his new students in action. An ex-soldier who has forsaken the
            use of firearms after she was shot in the leg.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>The amount of customization you can assign to your skills and stats help paint a
         detailed, vibrant personality for your characters... and give you added options when
         exploring the wasteland. That same injured pit fighter who knows how to talk about
         hand
         to hand combat with brawlers may gain information others cannot... or be able to earn
         money or earn respect through fighting in the arena itself and with enough medical
         knowledge to keep them going in-between matches. <span class="GP">An assassin that
            specializes in lockpicking may unlock the back entrance to a hideout of Leather
            Thugs, take out their leader while he's sleeping, and then leave quietly before the
            other dozen gang members know he's there. A laser-toting doctor may be able to gain
            access to a community with his medical know-how, and when they get within range of
            a
            target, use their laser weapon skills to surgically take out a town's gun turrets
            and pave the way for other Rangers to storm the place.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Assigning points over the course of the game into your chosen skills and stats can
         allow
         you to decide how each character grows as an individual. Your wounded pit fighter
         might
         gain new strength in his arms and have his cartilage repaired at Ranger Center, gaining
         more Agility. Your boxing coach may develop into the most skilled doctor the Rangers
         have ever known, and your ex-soldier may discover that some recently discovered horrors
         requires she take up the Rifle again and become a sniper to help her comrades... and
         herself... survive.</p>
             
      
      <h3 class="#CustomizationPlus">Customization Plus:</h3>
      
      <p><span class="GP"> We don't stop there.
            Customization extends beyond creating your characters' stats and looks; it
            translates to the user interface, customizing and outfitting your own weapon from
            what you can scrounge from the environment, swaging your ammo and even what
            portraits you want to import in the game to represent your character</span> (Why
         settle for what we give you? Choose whatever you want, draw your own, or find something
         better on line, or</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>even round out your party with pictures of your family members and co-workers!). Make
         the
         world, the interface, the playstyle, and your character yours, and role-play the way
         you
         want to.</p>
      
      
      <h4>Interface that Caters to You:</h4>
      <p> Wasteland 2 allows not only character and
         world customization, but interface layout and design customization as well. With the
         range of game mechanics permitted inside and outside of combat, we don't want to limit
         you solely to customizing your character - <span class="GP">we allow you to
            customize your interface to match your playstyle and choose the "language" and
            format with which you communicate with the game.</span></p>
      
      
      <h4>Band of Brothers:</h4>
      <p> Like the original, <span class="GP">Wasteland 2 is a
            party-based game</span> - you and your Rangers are a team, a band of brothers.
         Creating a party of individuals with depth and freedom is something unique to Wasteland
         and reinforces the Rangers as an organization -- not only are you fighting to build
         communities, your Rangers are a community, too, and you can feel that in the gameplay
         mechanics and interactions.</p>
      
      
      <h4>NPC's:</h4>
      <p><span class="NPC"> In addition to your ranger party you will have
            NPCs join the group each with their own personalities, motivations, and agendas --
            while they may excel in lockpicking, swinging a chainsaw through Leather Jerks, or
            sniping a War Droid and clipping its sensors at a block away, they have their own
            opinions they'll act on over the course of the game. They don't always blindly
            follow you into radiation-infested buildings, they may quietly hoard drugs and money
            that they find, or even possibly decide to borrow things from you as needed. They
            may have a childhood fear of rats that causes them to burn SMG clips in fury
            whenever those creatures appear. If they don't like someone in the party, they won't
            be shy about it -- or they may actively encourage you to send certain characters on
            solo missions provided they leave their canteen and supplies behind. The feeling is
            that you'll be traveling with characters, not drones with certain skill sets, and
            knowing their personality strengths and motivations is one of the most important
            tools for survival.</span></p>
      
      <img src="images//wasteland_02.PNG" alt=""/>
      
      
      <h4>Open World:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="setting">Adventure lies in the ruins of every city block, in the
            irradiated glow of distant mountain ranges, and in the depths of Devil's Crater. It
            can be heard whispering and begging in the frequencies on your radio, bristling with
            threats from unseen enemies or people begging for help -- this world is buzzing,
            burning, and alive around you. It isn't a world you have to explore, it's a world
            you want to explore.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Presented through an <span class="GP">easily-traversable world map and close-quarter
            gameplay maps for detailed explorations</span>, we allow you to <span class="GP">explore the Wasteland at the pace you want. Go anywhere you want, test the limits,
            test your enemies and gauge their strength (taking the bad road is your choice, and
            you own your mistakes if you don't heed rumors or don't proceed
            cautiously).</span></p>
           
      
      <h4>A Beckoning World, Not a Forced March:</h4>
      <p> Wasteland 2 baits you and lures
         you into exploring a variety of ways -- the promise of what lies in a <span class="setting">ghostly skyscraper in the depths of downtown LA, in the floating
            wreckage of submerged harbors and in the lower decks of abandoned cruise liners,
            tracks that lead to an old mine shaft in a mountain side...</span> but <span class="lore">no
            tracks leading out, and a mysterious broadcast whispering in Russian, a rapidfire
            Morse code signal, or the staccato of insane cult-speak hammered out on the
            radio...</span> all of these events are fishhooks dangled throughout the environment
         to pull you in.</p>
              
      
      <h4>Narrative Depth:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">Words help you navigate the world - and define it as well. Dialogue
            and interactions in Wasteland 2 are intended to carry the same thrill of reward and
            knowledge that exploring an abandoned weapons factory might... and provide one of
            the best ways to learn about the culture and attitude of a faction, cult, or gang
            in
            a region.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">Many of the greatest moments in Wasteland were communicated via text
            and lore paragraphs, and it elevated the story, not detracted from it. We're not
            afraid of text, and we're not afraid to use it to emphasize and support the world
            in
            ways the environment can't show visually. We want to use it to provide a deep
            narrative experience, and we'll have a strong conversation system to support it --
            you can type in keywords as part of your arsenal to unlock secrets and text
            fragments... paying attention to the world and key words can often create new paths
            in a conversation or give you new clues, hints, and even passwords to unlock new
            areas for you to explore.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>Words as Weapons:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">There's nothing like the threatening urgency that comes when a
            guard with an itchy trigger finger stops you to demand the password, and you're
            wracking your brain to try and find the right word that comes to mind - and for
            those looking to provoke a firefight, the wrong word dropped at the right time can
            cause an effect-chain that even a gunfight would be hard to top.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>The World is Watching You:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">The world reacts to who's in your party, your appearance, your
            choices, your health -- and more. It's a world that's watching you and reacting in
            ways you would expect the inhabitants of the world would... encountering a horde of
            Leather Jerks shortly after being bloodied and out of ammo from an unexpected Reagan
            Hover Tank fight is going to spark a much different reaction that rolling onto the
            scene with upgraded automatic weapons and proton axes while riding the same Hover
            Tank you were fighting previously. On the flip side, entering a room with security
            robots while wearing normal clothes and no weapons displayed may allow safe passage
            where a fully-tricked out</span></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>party bristling with weapons may trigger a much different experience... the world
         acts in
         predictable and unpredictable ways, but there is reason, logic, and reactivity that
         can
         be seen, studied, and eventually used to your advantage once you learn the ways of
         the
         world.</p>
              
      
      <h4>Cause and Effect:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">Reactivity happens on a micro and macro level, and doesn't stop
            with a single reactive event -- the consequences persist and build over the course
            of the game, and you can continue to contribute to the consequences over time -- you
            don't make just one ripple in the water, you can keep sending ripples outward by
            repeatedly tossing stones into the world to keep the effects going.</span>
         <span class="dev">This was one of the pillars of Wasteland that made it unique,
            and we'll uphold it and evolve it in Wasteland 2.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>Modding:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="dev">Lastly, this world isn't a living world because of our efforts.
            Thanks to you, we hit our mod tools goal, and we're eager to see what the community
            can develop with the toolset. Games such as FalloutTM and Neverwinter NightsTM have
            shown the power of fan-developed content, and we want to see how you change and
            expand the world of Wasteland. Wasteland 2 is yours to tinker, edit, and expand and
            share with others.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>Style:</h4>
      <p> A world isn't just its mechanics -- in Wasteland 2, you are in a
         world unlike any other. <span class="setting">Nuclear devastation hit the world while
            it was still pulling out of the 90s, and you'll see it in the environment and
            culture all around - and it's in these details, large and small, that the game
            shines.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">The world's got an edge, and a bizarre one - no one thought the
            apocalypse would shake out this way, and now your Rangers have the task of dealing
            with it, from the freaks, to the mutants, to the cultural debris and menagerie of
            bizarre opponents that treat trinkets of the past like a religion. It's evident all
            around you in the hulks of Trans Ams, towns of freakshows and drooling mutations,
            or
            even in the howls of a crazed cultist screaming for his allies to charge in the name
            of their god, "the Gipper." From punker gangs to references and homages to Reagan's
            Star Wars orbiting defense platform, you'll find yourself a world where the Road
            Warrior, Goonies, TRON, Rocky IV, the Thing, the Fly, Aliens, Scanners, Blade
            Runner, and Robocop all made their mark. The MTV generation was in full swing, and
            the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star" was never more true.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>Even the nuts and bolts of combat has a unique flavor, whether you're reducing opponents
         to thin red paste, exploding them like blood sausages, or sending enemies into a
         spinning dance of death.</p>
              
      
      <h4>Humor:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="setting">Humor is essential to Wasteland, and like the original, we'll
            pace it well, using dark humor, a touch of the odd, intermixed with the serious
            moments to bring the world to life and create a spectrum few games are capable
            of.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">While the threat to the world is a serious one, there are plenty
            of light-hearted moments along the way, just like in the original game. From gangs
            of Midwestern-style housewives packing arsenals of guns, clown gangs, robots with
            the slow drone of a modem connection establishing as they roll in to attack... all
            of these things are dangerous, but also intended to remind you of the light-hearted
            nature of the world you're in.</span></p>
      
      
      <h4>Game Mechanics that tell the Story:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">The best moments and stories in games come from systems, not
            through extended exposition or long cut scenes. Sneaking, fighting, and talking your
            way through a problem are all possible in Wasteland 2, and more -- sometimes simply
            presenting a stolen pass or saying the right password can cause enemies to ignore
            you or lower their guard enough to get by (or give you a chance to slit their
            throats and silence them). Other times, firing an RPG-7 into a hideout crawling with
            pistol-packing priests is the best, expedient way to settle a problem -- although
            gassing them, joining them, bribing them, or luring a bloodthirsty nest of Sewer
            Lizards into their lair can be a lot of fun, too.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">The story is in the moment, and you create and observe the
            consequences of those systems playing out. While we'll still have numerous colorful
            characters you can interact with, interesting quests, and clever dialogue, it's not
            done at the cost of telling your friends about how Vicki Stixx unloaded her SMG
            clips into a horde of rats because she's terrified of them, how you survived a
            mutant mob by luring them into a narrow trash alley and felling them one by one with
            a Proton Ax, or how you managed to crawl out of the wasteland after your canteen got
            stolen then made it back to base with one hit point just in time to kick the shit
            out of the bastard that stole it from you... or put a bullet in his
            skull.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>One Goal, Multiple Rangers:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">Your party isn't designed to be bunched up like a pair of panties
            after 5th period competitive wedgie class. You can control up to seven individuals
            (four rangers and three NPCs), all of which you can command (and in the case of
            companions, suggest) to perform specific actions toward a higher goal. Split them
            up
            to cover more ground, perform multiple tasks at the same time, reform them, and then
            strike while your opponents are trying to figure out what the hell just
            happened.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">You can divide and conquer in combat. If you need someone to move
            quickly and quietly to pick a lock while your sniper covers the door from a nest
            across the street as your resident brainiac reprograms the ventilation system to
            spew out exhaust, then split up your party and act like Desert Rangers do - you're
            a
            unit, but a unit that you can split and assign individual tasks to defeat opponents
            or solve puzzles and quests in the environment.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>There'll be times where splitting is to your advantage... and other times where it
         could
         put everyone at risk.</p>
              
      
      <h4>One Goal, Multiple Paths:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="GP">An RPG's main strength is allowing you to approach a quest, situation,
            or even an adversarial character in multiple ways and using your attributes, skills,
            or items to solve a problem.</span>
         <span class="GP">In Wasteland 2, even the range of options for something as simple
            as a locked door puzzle provides multiple choices for strategy -- strength, proton
            axes, TNT, lockpicking, and crowbars can all be a means to bust down a stubborn
            door... but each one can lead to different results depending on what's on the other
            side. Giving options is the goal, not narrowing your choices.</span>
         </p>
              
      
      <h4>Community Involvement:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="dev">Wasteland 2 was funded by you and is being built based on your
            feedback. You have voiced the type of game you want to see and play. The fan
            interactions on our forums helped craft this vision document and will continue to
            improve the Wasteland design. As well, during our</span></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p><span class="dev">Kickstarter campaign, we received hundreds of requests to get
            involved in building this rich world. If you're a talented artist, writer, sound
            engineer or any other discipline that can improve the game for all who pledged, we
            want to allow you to leave your mark. We are opening up a thread on our forums where
            you can post work samples and have a chance to work on, and be credited in,
            Wasteland 2.</span></p>
              
      
      <h4>The Look of the World:</h4>
      <p>
         <span class="setting">Wasteland also draws strength through its visual style. We don't
            want continual stretches of barren, desolate, single-color landscapes -- we want
            green, vibrant overgrowth crawling across the terrain and over buildings and
            skyscrapers, colorful patchwork signs and facades dotting the horizon, river-cut
            canyons, and other environmental lures intended to draw you forward.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">And as you explore the world, you'll see hints of what the world
            was like before as well. The world before the cataclysm was a society of towering
            skyscrapers of steel, concrete and glass. Styled after architecture of the 70's and
            80's and 90's their striking geometric forms cut into the blue skies.</span></p>
      
      <img src="images//wasteland_03.PNG" alt=""/>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">In parts of the world, the environment is shrouded in a Dust Bowl.
            Persistent dust storms roll across the desolate wastes, blanketing the world with
            caustic dust. Unlike the society before, life in the wastes is bleak and hard. In
            other parts of the wasteland, vegetation-covered cities and rusted hulks of cars,
            robots, and discarded remnants of the years before create a dangerous landscape
            where mutants and gangs lie in wait for easy prey.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="setting">The once glimmering cities of glass and steel lie in ruin. Cars
            and other futuristic debris litter the landscape as a reminder of the world that
            once was. The dichotomy of the harsh wastelands against the remnants of the lost
            future creates a truly compelling world.</span></p>

      <h3 class="#GameMechanicsandTact">Game Mechanics and Tactics that allow for your approach and your
         play-style:</h3>
      
      <p>
         <span class="GP">Combat in Wasteland 2 is turn-based and tactical, the approach to
            battles requires strategy, even choices in how to outfit and customize your gun
            greatly modify your chance of success. Ammo is a resource. It's scarce. Healing is
            tough. Your fellow Desert Rangers have various strengths and weakness, and your
            recruits often have personality traits you need to balance and keep an eye on,
            depending on the encounter.</span>
         </p>
      
      <p><span class="GP">Flank opponents, switch gear, learn to use fog of war and line of
            sight to outflank opponents and go for quick kills before an alert can be sounded...
            or you can approach a combat simply and aggressively, taking a lot more damage and
            damaging your gear but reaching your objective quicker.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">If that's not to your liking, use patience and demolitions to lure
            your opponents into a prepared kill zone of traps, explosives, and sniper bullets
            that can cut through opposition like a proton knife through butter. It's your call,
            your choice, and your risk -- and enjoyed through your game-play style, not
            ours.</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="GP">We give you great control during combat, but it doesn't have to be a
            slog. While tough fights are just that, you can get through minor threats quickly.
            Once combat is initiated, turn based progression begins, but if you have the
            overwhelming advantage you can just let your guys go to work without micro-managing
            the tactics.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>We give you the tools and the rules - then stand back and let you do the rest.</p>
