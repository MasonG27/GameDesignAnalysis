        Diablo Game Pitch

        Diablo is a role-playing game created by Condor, Inc and released in 1996. This document, made in 1994, was the original pitch for the game to describe elements such as gameplay, marketing, and development.

      <h2>Diablo Game Pitch</h2><img src="images/diablo_start.png" alt="The cover page of the Diablo pitch document."></img><div class="intro">
         <p><span class="dev">The following is Condor, Inc.'s proposal for a role-playing game, playable on
               PC-compatible computers. Diablo captures familiar fantasy elements within a unique
               structure designed for maximum replayability, expandability, and versatility. Diablo
               fills a neglected niche in the computer game market. As games today substitute
               gameplay with multimedia extravaganzas, and strive toward needless scale and
               complexity, we seek to reinvigorate the hack and slash, feel good gaming audience.
               Emphasis will be on exploration, conflict and character development in a dark quest
               for justice. We hope to produce both a stand-alone game and its expansion disks.
               This initial document will be expanded upon and modified when development is
               initiated.</span></p>

      <h3>GAME DESIGN</h3>
      <h4>OVERVIEW:</h4>
      <h4>PLOT AND SETTING:</h4>
      <h4>GAMEPLAY:</h4><img src="images/diablo_01.png" alt="Diagram of the floor spaces described above."></img><img src="images/diablo_02.png" alt="Illustration."></img><img src="images/diablo_03.png" alt="Diagram of how a level is constructed."></img><img src="images/diablo_04.png" alt="Close-up picture of a demon/the devil."></img><img src="images/diablo_05.png" alt="Illustration."></img><p><span class="GP">Diablo is a role playing game</span> <span class="GP">wherein a player creates a single character and guides
            him through a dungeon in an attempt to find and destroy 'Diablo', the devil himself.
            All the action takes place in an isometric, three-quarter perspective, with
            diamond-shaped, 'square' floor spaces (see diagram). The entire game operates on a
            turn-based system. Using a mouse, the player moves his character from space to
            space, exploring corridors and rooms and engaging in combat. The character faces
            challenges in the form of hostile monsters and traps in his quest to descend deeper
            into the dungeon. Many beneficial weapons and magical items can be acquired and used
            to help on this quest.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">A player will have the choice of many races and classes for his character. The
            player's character will develop as he defeats monsters and descends to deeper
            dungeon levels. A character will acquire new skills, improve fighting and magic
            abilities, and wield more powerful equipment.</span></p>
      <p>Forays into the dungeon will be broken up by trips to the town located above. <span class="GP">In the
            town, a general store will provide standard equipment and repairs, and will also
            purchase extra equipment from the player. A temple will provide healing for injured
            and sick characters. Training and other facilities may also be available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">The heart of Diablo is the randomly created dungeon. A new dungeon level is generated
            each time a level is entered using our Dynamic Random Level Generation (DRLG)
            System. Rooms, corridors, traps, treasures monsters and stairways will be randomly
            placed, providing anew gaming experience every time Diablo is played. In addition
            to
            random halls and rooms, larger 'set piece' areas, like a maze or a crypt complex,
            will be predesigned and appear intact in the levels. This system facilitates the
            indusion of puzzles and traps, and helps the addition of thematic elements. Deeper
            levels will contain progressively more difficult creatures and hazards. A
            character's quest ends with the defeat of Diablo, located deep in the dungeon.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">Expandability and replay value are key to Diablo's success. The randomly generated
            dungeon insures new opportunities for exploration as well as unique encounters and
            adventures; no two games will ever be the same. New magic items, creatures, traps,
            as well as complete scenarios can be added to the base game after the initial
            purchase and incorporated directly into the DRLG engine (see discussion of expansion
            packs later in this document). This expandability further adds to continued replay
            value.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">Diablo will support 2-player and multi-player game sessions via modem or network.
            A
            special 'arena' dungeon will be available for opponents to pit their characters
            against each other. In two-player mode, a user-defined time limit forces players to
            move quickly; if they do not specify a move, they lose their opportunity during that
            turn. As soon as all players register an action, the game progresses, regardless of
            time limit. The ability to play against friends will add to the appeal of the
            expansion packs as players will seek the upper hand versus their friends.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">Diablo is set in a fantastic, medieval world, where sword-and-sorcery-wielding heroes
            battle the forces of darkness. The player's character has just had his life thrown
            upside down when sinister raiders kill his family and destroy his home. Left with
            nothing but a desire for vengeance, the character traces the raiders steps to a
            crypt and an expansive labyrinth below. Gathering up his courage and initial
            weapons, he dives in with fury.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">The world of Diablo will have a dark, evil tone.</span> <span class="setting">Initial levels will be set in an
            abandoned Gothic church. A marble mausoleum and progressively darker, dingier crypts
            and catacombs follow. Deeper, natural cave formations lead to supernatural, demonic
            halls, and finally to the opulent chambers of Diablo.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">Creatures to be encountered will also follow this sinister theme. The undead will
            predominate in the form of</span> <span class="NPC">skeletons, zombies, ghosts and the like. Deeper levels
            will be populated with lesser demons and chaos-spawn. A sprinkling of 'natural'
            creatures, such as spiders and snakes will add variety.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">Magic items will reflect a religious/demonic theme. For example, a 'Mephistopheles
            Cloak' might allow limited control over lesser evil creatures, while a 'Holy Mace'
            may be just the thing to shatter pesky skeletons.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">An open ending will allow for different themes in future sequels, where goblin caves
            or a living fungus world will have to be explored and conquered.</span> <span class="dev">The player will
            simply have to purchase an expansion disk to have access to these new worlds.</span></p>
      <p>A walk-through of an example game session follows:</p>
      <p><span class="GP">After starting up the game, the opening cinematic sequence segues into the main menu
            screen. The three options provided are: New Character, Load Character, and Options.
            New Character allows the player to develop a character and start at the beginning.
            Load Character picks up where an existing character last left the game, or allows
            a
            player to select a pre-generated character to 'quick-start' the game. The Options
            selection gives access to sound and configuration options.</span></p>
      <p><span class="PC">A player generating a new character is first presented with a choice of race. We plan
            to offer five or six human races Chill people, forest people, etc.) each with
            advantages and disadvantages. After race, the player will select his desired class;
            choosing either a fighter, thief or magician, or possibly sub classes of these.
            Although all characters will be able to use most weapons, and cast some spells,
            different classes will provide special advantages. Fighters will gain extra attacks,
            thieves will move faster and with greater stealth, and magicians will have more
            spells and cast them more powerfully. After making these choices, the computer will
            provide basic statistics for the character in the categories of strength, magical
            aptitude, dexterity and vitality. The player will then be given some discretionary
            points to distribute as he sees fit. Magician characters will pick from
            approximately four 'schools' of magic. There will also be a general school, the
            spells of which are available to all characters. A character will be provided with
            some initial cquipment and gold and then placed in town, where play begins.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">If a player had instead chosen Load Character from the main menu and then picked one
            of the pre-generated characters, all of the preceding would be skipped and the
            'quick-start' character would start in town, already equipped.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">The town is presented in our isometric view with a main road, a town square, and a
            dozen or so buildings. The player will move his character around by placing the
            mouse-controlled cursor on the 'square' he wishes to walk to and left-clicking.
            Left-clicking on a square will cause the character to move to the selected square
            by
            the shortest route possible.</span> <span class="GP">Left-clicking on an item or creature will cause the
            character to move next to it. If already adjacent to an item or creature, a
            left-click causes the character to interact in the appropriate way (trade with a
            shopkeeper, attack a creature, open a chest. etc.). Right clicking will cast the
            readied spell in the indicated location. The arrow keys will scroll the map
            independently of the character.</span> <span class="GP">Moving about the town, the character can visit
            various shops to purchase further equipment, a temple for healing, and his home to
            rest and store extraneous items and gold.</span></p>
      <p><span class="setting">The fun really begins when the player guides his character down the road and enters
            the abandoned temple (the first level of the dungeon). At this point, the computer
            generates the layout of the first level.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">The player can see as much of the dungeon as is visible to the character, determined
            by lighting, line-of-sight, and magical factors. Areas not brightened by light
            sources fade into blackness. Magical 'darkness' can block light sources. Infravision
            can detect heat sources within dark areas (providing red shapes of creatures in the
            distance). As the character moves around, new sections of the dungeon are revealed.
            If a player dicks on a distant square and a creature comes into view in the middle
            of the route, the character will stop to await new orders.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">The game runs on a turn-by-turn basis, the player moves, then the opponent(s)
            move(s). Each character and monster may have a certain amount of action points which
            would determine what actions are possible in a given turn. For instance: a fighter
            character turns a corner to suddenly see a skeleton, eight squares away. The player
            left-clicks two squares ahead to close the distance. As the fighter moves forward
            two squares, the skeleton also moves forward two squares and a new skeleton comes
            into view. Moving more carefully, the player clicks one square ahead. The first
            skeleton also moves one square while the second fires an arrow, hitting the fighter.
            Again the player moves forward one square. The first skeleton moves on to the square
            directly in front of the fighter and the second fires another arrow, missing. Now
            the fighter and first skeleton exchange blows, with yet another arrow fired by the
            archer skeleton. Determining that the fighter can't keep sustaining the damage, the
            player clicks six spaces back, in retreat. The first skeleton follows, one space
            behind. The archer skeleton fires each turn until the fighter ducks back around the
            corner.</span></p>
      <p><span class="GP">Assuming the fighter escapes, he will go on to explore the dungeon and finally reach
            the stairs to the next level, whereupon a new level will be generated. If one of
            those arrows ends up killing the fighter, that character will be erased completely
            from the hard drive and the player must start from scratch.</span></p>
      <h3>MARKETING</h3>
      <p><span class="dev">While Diablo shares familiar role-playing elements with other games in this genre,
            its unique structure allows a different marketing strategy, one that could lead to
            sustained, long-term sales.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">There are really two products here: Diablo, which stands on its own, and its
            expansion packs. These packs would consist of one disk and maybe an information card
            in a small package. The disk would contain new elements that are directly
            installable into the base Diablo game. These elements would include: new magic
            items, new creatures, new traps and new level graphics. Expansion disks would all
            be
            different (or maybe 16 or 32 combinations) and would contain approximately 16 new
            dements in varying degrees of rarity. A sample disk might contain: one rare sword,
            three uncommon magic items, eight common items, two creatures, one trap, and a new
            hallway type.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">A player would buy a new expansion disk or two, go home and install the new data into
            his game. The new elements would be incorporated into the random mix when a new
            level is generated. Perhaps a player's character should have one goodie directly
            placed into his inventory for instant gratification.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">We believe these expansion disks should be priced at around $4.95 with the hope that
            they would be placed near cash registers as point-of-purchase items. Players would
            buy these packs as an afterthought, or maybe in an attempt to collect them all. A
            'collector'-type art card, representing the rare item in a pack, could enhance this
            sense of collectability.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">If Diablo and the expansion packs prove successful, additional expansion pack series
            could be released. Each series would have a theme like Dark Nightmares or Holy
            Avengers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">This marketing strategy provides many benefits. Expansion packs would add to
            replayability and lengthen the life-span of the product, while providing additional
            and continuous revenues with minimal investment. Point-of-purchase displays would
            serve as advertising, directing people towards Diablo on the shelves. The
            collectible nature would lead to increased sales.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">The unorthodox nature of Diablo and its expansion packs would be unique in the
            computer game world, but it is not without precedent and existing parallels. Magic:
            the Gathering provides some of the inspiration for marketing Diablo. The Expansion
            pack structure would serve as our model. The collectible nature also transfers. The
            tremendous success of Magic is testament to the willingness of players to continue
            to make small additional purchases to revitalize their existing game. In the
            computer gaming world, Diablo and its expansion packs would have no real
            competition. Magic is sold at the register at Electronics Boutique stores; Diablo,
            being a computer game, would fit in nicely.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">Some precedent can also be found in shareware and demos sold at the register at
            computer stores. The success of speech packs, expansions and sequels for computer
            roll-playing games, provides further evidence that Diablo's expansion packs could
            be
            successful.</span></p>
      <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3><img src="images/diablo_06.png" alt="Illustration of a demonic figure."></img><img src="images/diablo_dev_table.png" alt="Table of the development timelinefor Diablo."></img><p><span class="dev">Condor plans to spend one year in the development of Diablo. Personnel will consist
            of: one designer; one chief programmer and two junior programmer; two art
            director/artists, one illustrator/sculptor and three pixel artist/illustrators; and
            one music/sound effects person.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">Diablo will be art-intensive. We intend for the game to operate in Super VGA mode
            (640x480 pixels). The three-quarter perspective requires eight directions of
            movement, three of which can sometimes be flipped. Each monster will have multiple
            graphic deaths and will require at least 50 frames of animations. We envision
            approximately 16 monsters to start with. The player's character will require many
            more frames to cover different kinds of attacks, casting spells, opening chests,
            etc. Different weapons, armor and clothing types will be reflected in character
            sprites. There will be five or six initial level types as well as an above-ground
            town. Additional art requirements include cinematics, title screens, character
            creation screens and inventory screens.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">The programming department's initial task will be the development of a clean,
            intuitive interface. After this, an overall shell structure, the Dynamic Random
            Level Generator, and a sound driver will be implemented in time to allow at least
            4
            months of bug testing, and most importantly, play balance.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">Music will consist of an opening theme and atmospheric music to accompany game play.
            Sound effects will cover fighting, spell casting, walking and the like.</span></p>
      <p><span class="dev">The initial development schedule proceeds as follows:</span></p>
