        <h2>Project Updates</h2>
        <h3>Update 1 - 09/23/2020</h3>
        <p>For the first update, we gathered some information and will begin our project on the original BioShock game. 
            After some conversion, we got a raw text file and edited slightly to include bullet points and other symbol recognition.</p>

        <h3>Update 2 - 10/05/2020</h3>
        <p>For our second update we began to form a schema around the BioShock game. It is going to be changing as we continue to work though because we plan to include 3 other pitch documents in this project.</p>
        <p>We began to form a research question surrounding the other pitch documents we were thinking of adding to the project.</p>
        <p>Added the following pitch documents: The Flame in the Flood as well as the original Diablo game.
            We saw these as great additions as FITF has diversity with lots of images and art while Diablo is a very old document that uses lots of paragraph style.</p>

        <h3>Update 3 - 10/14/2020</h3>
        <p>We began to reform the schema in order to be more compatible with multiple pitch documents that vary in structure.</p>

        <p>We added another pitch document to our research, Wasteland 2.</p>

        <h3>Update 4 - 11/10/2020</h3>
        <p>We made significant progress on XML markup for the BioShock document.</p>

        <p>We also made great progress on the schema, making some adjustments as we progressed through the BioShock document.</p>

        <p>Added lots of content to the website. Continuing to think of different ideas for the final layout in order to keep things accessible and organized.</p>
        
        <h3>Update 5 - 12/09/2020</h3>
        <p>The website was edited and updated to aid in accessability and organization, and a Creative Commons license was added. All website code is available on our project's <a href="https://github.com/MasonG27/GameDesignAnalysis">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
