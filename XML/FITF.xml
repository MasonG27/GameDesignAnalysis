        <title>The Flame in the Flood</title>
        <description>The Flame in the Flood is a wilderness survival game in which a girl and her
            dog travel by foot and by raft down a procedurally-generated river. Scrounge for
            resources, craft tools, remedy afflictions, evade the vicious wildlife and, most
            importantly, stay healthy in a dangerous wilderness.</description>
