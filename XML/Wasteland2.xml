        <intro>
            <title>Prologue</title>

            <p>In the <setting stype="time">early seventies</setting>, an astronomer located a
                cluster of meteors that would cross Earth's path in the summer of <setting stype="time">ninety eight</setting>. Keeping this secret was the government's
                top priority. First, they did not want to panic the populace. Second, they saw it as
                a way to get the upper-hand against the Soviets. Building a meteor defense platform
                became the United States' number one priority. It took <setting stype="time">15
                    years</setting> to build the Citadel Starstation, a highly advanced orbital
                nuclear anti-meteor missile platform. The United States' Citadel Starstation was
                slated to be fully operational by March, just months before the meteors were
                believed to be arriving. Tensions grew with the coming of <setting stype="time">1998</setting>, the Soviets charging that the space station was merely a
                military launching platform, alarming a number of nonaligned nations.</p>

            <p>Two weeks before Citadel was due for full operation, the station transmitted a
                distress signal. Undetected, a cloud of small meteorites preceded the main cluster.
                Though they were no threat to Earth, Earth's satellites were a different story.
                Immediately after the message was sent, most of the satellites orbiting the planet
                were swept clean from the sky, leaving the great powers blind. In military panic,
                each sent 90 percent of their nuclear arsenals skyward. Although the destruction was
                tremendous, it was not complete. Pockets of civilization remained, some even
                oblivious to the military exchange.</p>

            <p><setting>The world of today is the antithesis of the clean, futuristic society that
                    came before. Wasteland is a world in decay. The once glimmering cities of glass
                    and steel lie in ruin. Rusted hulls of cars litter the urban environment as a
                    reminder of the world that once was.</setting></p>

            <p>The survivors of the cataclysm have banded together into small frontier communities.
                Not unlike the Wild West hundreds of years prior, the world of today is an age of
                rugged individualism; a society where the ties between individuals are loose and
                everyone is expected to look after himself and his own.</p>

            <p>Some towns have the benefit of a pre-cataclysm renewable power source, such as a
                small wind turbine or solar dish. In the midst of a <setting stype="theme">technological dark age</setting>, few have the knowledge and means to recreate
                these power sources, making them coveted and often fought-over commodities. The few
                who have the know-how to maintain the old technologies are highly sought after and
                often command a lot of influence.</p>

            <pb/>

            <p>On the same day destruction rained down from the sky, a company of U.S. Army
                Engineers were in the southwestern deserts building transportation bridges over dry
                riverbeds. They worked deep in the inhospitable desert valleys, surrounded by a
                number of survivalist communities. Located directly south of their position on that
                day was a newly-constructed federal prison. In addition to housing the nation's
                criminals condemned to death, the prison contained light industrial manufacturing
                facilities.</p>

            <p>Shortly after the cataclysm began, the Engineers, seeking shelter, took over the
                federal prison and expelled the prisoners into the desolate desert to complete their
                sentences. As the weeks passed, they invited the nearby survivalist communities to
                join them and to help them build a new society. Because of each community's
                suspicions towards one another, times were difficult at first. But as time nurtured
                trust, this settlement - which came to be known as <setting stype="place">Ranger
                    Center</setting> - grew to be one of the strongest outposts. Ranger Center even
                proved powerful enough to repel the hands of rancorous criminals who repeatedly
                attacked in attempts to reclaim what was once "rightfully" theirs.</p>

            <p>The citizens of <setting stype="place">Ranger Center</setting>, after first believing
                that they were the only ones who survived the nuclear cataclysm, soon realized that
                communities beyond the desert's grip had also survived. Because they had such
                success in constructing a new community, they felt compelled to help other survivors
                rebuild and live in peace.</p>

            <p>Toward this end, the Desert Rangers, in the great tradition of the Texas and Arizona
                Rangers a century before, were born.</p>

        <title>A Little History</title>
        
            <p><dev dtype="background">Developed by Interplay, the first Wasteland was released in 1988 on the Apple II, C64
                and PC.</dev></p>
            <p><dev dtype="background">Wasteland was the first post-apocalyptic computer RPG and is recognized as a true
                classic; Computer Gaming World named it the 9th best game of all time. Adored by
                fans, Wasteland is one of the few 20+ year old RPGs that is still discussed on
                Internet forums.</dev></p>
            <p><dev dtype="background">Wasteland set the RPG standard of its time with its engaging story, open world and
                strong party-driven role-playing system. We are taking these strong elements, that
                made Wasteland a classic, and bringing them into the 21st century, giving you an
                experience unlike anything available today.</dev></p>

        <title>Game Overview</title>

        <p><GP gtype="genre">Wasteland 2 reintroduces the concept of party driven adventuring, a style of game-play
            untapped for many years. Having a party of characters will re-introduce game-play
            dynamics rarely seen in today's RPGs.</GP></p>

        <p><lore>As a team of Desert Rangers, it is your job to restore order in this lawless
            post-apocalyptic landscape. How you do it is up to you. Interact with hundreds of
            characters across the world, shaping your own destiny. Who you choose for your team will
            add dimension to your party interactions, opening new possibilities for you to explore.</lore>
            Will the wastes remember you and your team as diplomatic defenders of justice? As a
            group of intimidating, brutish thugs? Or somewhere in between? The choice is yours.</p>

        <p>The harsh reality of the wastes is that diplomacy and intimidation will only take you so
            far. With gangs, cultists and bizarre creatures at every turn, some problems often can
            only be settled at the end of a gun. As you and your team <GP gtype="mechanic">gain
                experience, it is up to you to shape your team's skills and abilities,</GP> building
            the perfect fighting force.</p>

<section name="Pillars">
        <title>Pillars</title>

    <subTitle>RPG:</subTitle><p> <dev dtype="marketing">RPGs haven't kept pace with time - they've
            regressed and even worse, taken pride in less roleplaying than before. Important
            elements have been lost over time, sacrificed to technology, art constraints, voice-over
            expenses, and multi-platform console constraints. Wasteland 2 has no such limitations,
            it brings these RPG elements back, takes them out of the attic, and makes them part of
            gameplay again.</dev></p>

        <p><GP gtype="genre">True RPGs allow options, allow you to make fundamental choices in customization and
            character creation, and most importantly, allow you to role-play and make your impact in
            a living world and see the consequences around you.</GP></p>

        <p>And by consequence, we don't mean token one-node lip service, we mean reactions, even a
            chain of reactions that builds over the course of the game. <GP gtype="mechanic">Even
                simple RPG elements such as the ability to write</GP>
        </p>

        <pb/>


        <p><GP gtype="mechanic">your own character's bio (frequently lost in the console
                generation), importing your own portraits of your characters that you like better
                than what a developer gives you, to larger, more important goals such as tactical
                combat and extended options to approach battles and fights.</GP></p>

        <p>In Wasteland 2, these RPG mechanics are there to be discovered all over again:</p>


</section>
        
       <section name="Customization"> 
           <title>Customization:</title>
           <p><GP gtype="mechanic"> The ability to customize, alter, and
                improve your characters is as important as changing the world. Like the original
                Wasteland, your choice of what statistics and skills you invest in gives your
                characters personality, gives you multiple quest solutions, and gives you the
                ability to role-play beyond simply Thief, Fighter, or Mage archetypes. A low
                Charisma, low Agility, and high Strength character who specializes in medical skills
                and brawling can flesh out your characters with a sense of personality that other
                RPGs don't allow for... perhaps that of an injured pit fighter who learned to tend
                the wounds of others in arena brawls in Needles and Vegas. Or a down-on-their-luck
                boxing coach who signed up with the Rangers as an instructor then graduated to going
                on missions to watch his new students in action. An ex-soldier who has forsaken the
                use of firearms after she was shot in the leg.</GP></p>

        <p>The amount of customization you can assign to your skills and stats help paint a
            detailed, vibrant personality for your characters... and give you added options when
            exploring the wasteland. That same injured pit fighter who knows how to talk about hand
            to hand combat with brawlers may gain information others cannot... or be able to earn
            money or earn respect through fighting in the arena itself and with enough medical
            knowledge to keep them going in-between matches. <GP gtype="mechanic">An assassin that
                specializes in lockpicking may unlock the back entrance to a hideout of Leather
                Thugs, take out their leader while he's sleeping, and then leave quietly before the
                other dozen gang members know he's there. A laser-toting doctor may be able to gain
                access to a community with his medical know-how, and when they get within range of a
                target, use their laser weapon skills to surgically take out a town's gun turrets
                and pave the way for other Rangers to storm the place.</GP></p>

        <p>Assigning points over the course of the game into your chosen skills and stats can allow
            you to decide how each character grows as an individual. Your wounded pit fighter might
            gain new strength in his arms and have his cartilage repaired at Ranger Center, gaining
            more Agility. Your boxing coach may develop into the most skilled doctor the Rangers
            have ever known, and your ex-soldier may discover that some recently discovered horrors
            requires she take up the Rifle again and become a sniper to help her comrades... and
            herself... survive.</p>

                Customization extends beyond creating your characters' stats and looks; it
                translates to the user interface, customizing and outfitting your own weapon from

        <subTitle>Band of Brothers:</subTitle><p> Like the original, <GP gtype="genre">Wasteland 2 is a
                party-based game</GP> - you and your Rangers are a team, a band of brothers.
            Creating a party of individuals with depth and freedom is something unique to Wasteland
            and reinforces the Rangers as an organization -- not only are you fighting to build
            communities, your Rangers are a community, too, and you can feel that in the gameplay
            mechanics and interactions.</p>

<section name="NPCs">
        <subTitle>NPC's:</subTitle><p><NPC> In addition to your ranger party you will have
                NPCs join the group each with their own personalities, motivations, and agendas --
                while they may excel in lockpicking, swinging a chainsaw through Leather Jerks, or
                sniping a War Droid and clipping its sensors at a block away, they have their own
                opinions they'll act on over the course of the game. They don't always blindly
                follow you into radiation-infested buildings, they may quietly hoard drugs and money
                that they find, or even possibly decide to borrow things from you as needed. They
                may have a childhood fear of rats that causes them to burn SMG clips in fury
                whenever those creatures appear. If they don't like someone in the party, they won't
                be shy about it -- or they may actively encourage you to send certain characters on
                solo missions provided they leave their canteen and supplies behind. The feeling is
                that you'll be traveling with characters, not drones with certain skill sets, and
                knowing their personality strengths and motivations is one of the most important
                tools for survival.</NPC></p>

                Thanks to you, we hit our mod tools goal, and we're eager to see what the community
                can develop with the toolset. Games such as FalloutTM and Neverwinter NightsTM have
                shown the power of fan-developed content, and we want to see how you change and
                expand the world of Wasteland. Wasteland 2 is yours to tinker, edit, and expand and
                share with others.</dev></p>

<section name="Style">        
        <subTitle>Style:</subTitle><p> A world isn't just its mechanics -- in Wasteland 2, you are in a
            world unlike any other. <setting stype="theme">Nuclear devastation hit the world while
                it was still pulling out of the 90s, and you'll see it in the environment and
                culture all around - and it's in these details, large and small, that the game
                shines.</setting></p>

        <p><setting stype="theme">The world's got an edge, and a bizarre one - no one thought the
                apocalypse would shake out this way, and now your Rangers have the task of dealing
                with it, from the freaks, to the mutants, to the cultural debris and menagerie of
                bizarre opponents that treat trinkets of the past like a religion. It's evident all
                around you in the hulks of Trans Ams, towns of freakshows and drooling mutations, or
                even in the howls of a crazed cultist screaming for his allies to charge in the name
                of their god, "the Gipper." From punker gangs to references and homages to Reagan's
                Star Wars orbiting defense platform, you'll find yourself a world where the Road
                Warrior, Goonies, TRON, Rocky IV, the Thing, the Fly, Aliens, Scanners, Blade
                Runner, and Robocop all made their mark. The MTV generation was in full swing, and
                the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star" was never more true.</setting></p>

        <p>Even the nuts and bolts of combat has a unique flavor, whether you're reducing opponents
            to thin red paste, exploding them like blood sausages, or sending enemies into a
            spinning dance of death.</p>

            <setting stype="theme">Humor is essential to Wasteland, and like the original, we'll
                pace it well, using dark humor, a touch of the odd, intermixed with the serious
                moments to bring the world to life and create a spectrum few games are capable
                of.</setting></p>

        <p><setting stype="theme">While the threat to the world is a serious one, there are plenty
                of light-hearted moments along the way, just like in the original game. From gangs
                of Midwestern-style housewives packing arsenals of guns, clown gangs, robots with
                the slow drone of a modem connection establishing as they roll in to attack... all
                of these things are dangerous, but also intended to remind you of the light-hearted
                nature of the world you're in.</setting></p>

        <subTitle>Game Mechanics that tell the Story:</subTitle><p>
            <GP gtype="mechanic">The best moments and stories in games come from systems, not
                through extended exposition or long cut scenes. Sneaking, fighting, and talking your
                way through a problem are all possible in Wasteland 2, and more -- sometimes simply
                presenting a stolen pass or saying the right password can cause enemies to ignore
                you or lower their guard enough to get by (or give you a chance to slit their
                throats and silence them). Other times, firing an RPG-7 into a hideout crawling with
                pistol-packing priests is the best, expedient way to settle a problem -- although
                gassing them, joining them, bribing them, or luring a bloodthirsty nest of Sewer
                Lizards into their lair can be a lot of fun, too.</GP></p>

        <p><setting stype="theme">The story is in the moment, and you create and observe the
                consequences of those systems playing out. While we'll still have numerous colorful
                characters you can interact with, interesting quests, and clever dialogue, it's not
                done at the cost of telling your friends about how Vicki Stixx unloaded her SMG
                clips into a horde of rats because she's terrified of them, how you survived a
                mutant mob by luring them into a narrow trash alley and felling them one by one with
                a Proton Ax, or how you managed to crawl out of the wasteland after your canteen got
                stolen then made it back to base with one hit point just in time to kick the shit
                out of the bastard that stole it from you... or put a bullet in his
            skull.</setting></p>

            <GP gtype="mechanic">Your party isn't designed to be bunched up like a pair of panties
                after 5th period competitive wedgie class. You can control up to seven individuals
                (four rangers and three NPCs), all of which you can command (and in the case of
                companions, suggest) to perform specific actions toward a higher goal. Split them up
                to cover more ground, perform multiple tasks at the same time, reform them, and then
                strike while your opponents are trying to figure out what the hell just
                happened.</GP></p>

        <p><GP gtype="mechanic">You can divide and conquer in combat. If you need someone to move
                quickly and quietly to pick a lock while your sniper covers the door from a nest
                across the street as your resident brainiac reprograms the ventilation system to
                spew out exhaust, then split up your party and act like Desert Rangers do - you're a
                unit, but a unit that you can split and assign individual tasks to defeat opponents
                or solve puzzles and quests in the environment.</GP></p>

            <setting stype="theme">Wasteland also draws strength through its visual style. We don't
                want continual stretches of barren, desolate, single-color landscapes -- we want
                green, vibrant overgrowth crawling across the terrain and over buildings and
                skyscrapers, colorful patchwork signs and facades dotting the horizon, river-cut
                canyons, and other environmental lures intended to draw you forward.</setting></p>

        <p><setting stype="theme">And as you explore the world, you'll see hints of what the world
                was like before as well. The world before the cataclysm was a society of towering
                skyscrapers of steel, concrete and glass. Styled after architecture of the 70's and
                80's and 90's their striking geometric forms cut into the blue skies.</setting></p>

        <p><setting stype="theme">In parts of the world, the environment is shrouded in a Dust Bowl.
                Persistent dust storms roll across the desolate wastes, blanketing the world with
                caustic dust. Unlike the society before, life in the wastes is bleak and hard. In
                other parts of the wasteland, vegetation-covered cities and rusted hulks of cars,
                robots, and discarded remnants of the years before create a dangerous landscape
                where mutants and gangs lie in wait for easy prey.</setting></p>

                and other futuristic debris litter the landscape as a reminder of the world that

        <title>Game Mechanics and Tactics that allow for your approach and your
                play-style:</title>
        <p>
            <GP gtype="mechanic">Combat in Wasteland 2 is turn-based and tactical, the approach to
                battles requires strategy, even choices in how to outfit and customize your gun
                greatly modify your chance of success. Ammo is a resource. It's scarce. Healing is
                tough. Your fellow Desert Rangers have various strengths and weakness, and your
                recruits often have personality traits you need to balance and keep an eye on,
                depending on the encounter.</GP>
        </p>
        <p><GP gtype="mechanic">Flank opponents, switch gear, learn to use fog of war and line of
                sight to outflank opponents and go for quick kills before an alert can be sounded...
                or you can approach a combat simply and aggressively, taking a lot more damage and
                damaging your gear but reaching your objective quicker.</GP></p>

        <p><GP gtype="mechanic">If that's not to your liking, use patience and demolitions to lure
                your opponents into a prepared kill zone of traps, explosives, and sniper bullets
                that can cut through opposition like a proton knife through butter. It's your call,
                your choice, and your risk -- and enjoyed through your game-play style, not
                ours.</GP></p>

        <p><GP gtype="mechanic">We give you great control during combat, but it doesn't have to be a
                slog. While tough fights are just that, you can get through minor threats quickly.
                Once combat is initiated, turn based progression begins, but if you have the
                overwhelming advantage you can just let your guys go to work without micro-managing
                the tactics.</GP></p>

        <p>We give you the tools and the rules - then stand back and let you do the rest.</p>
